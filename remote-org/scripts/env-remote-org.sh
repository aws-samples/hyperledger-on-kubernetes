# The following section will be merged into env.sh and used to configure a remote peer
######################################################################################

# Type of network. Options are: POC or PROD
# If FABRIC_NETWORK_TYPE="PROD" I will generate NLB (network load balancers) to expose the orderers and anchor peers
# so they can communicate with remote peers located in other regions and/or accounts. This simulates a production network
# which consists of remote members, with peers on premise or on other Cloud platforms.
# If FABRIC_NETWORK_TYPE="POC" I will assume all peers and orderers are running in the same account / region and will
# assume local, in-cluster DNS using standard Kuberentes service names for lookup
FABRIC_NETWORK_TYPE="PROD"

# Names of the Orderer organizations. Regardless of the FABRIC_NETWORK_TYPE there will be a single
# Orderer org. You may change the names of the ORG and DOMAIN to match your organisation
ORDERER_ORGS="org0"
ORDERER_DOMAINS="org0"

# ORDERER_TYPE can be "kafka" or "solo". If you set this to Kafka, a Kafka/Zookeeper cluster will be created in
# the same AWS account as the orderer. Otherwise, you may choose 'solo'
# If FABRIC_NETWORK_TYPE="PROD", this should be set to kafka
ORDERER_TYPE="kafka"

# Names of the peer organizations.
PEER_ORGS="<joiner_org>"
PEER_DOMAINS="<joiner_org>"
PEER_PREFIX="peer"

# Number of peers in each peer organization
NUM_PEERS=1

REMOTE_PEER=true
